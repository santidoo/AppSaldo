AppSaldo lets you check your balance for prepaid simcards

** DISCLAIMER - READ BEFORE INSTALL **
1. This application is intended for users with PREPAID mobile phone (pay-as-you-go)
2. This application does not charge you for checking the balance, HOWEVER your carrier can do it. I am not responsible for it. I repeat, this app does not do magic.. if your carrier charges for balance inquiry, this app cannot do nothing about it. So please do not negative rate the app for it.
3. If your carrier charges you and you know any other way to check the balance for free, please email me, share the info with other users.

BALANCE INQUIRY APP:
Do you want to check your balance but you do not know how? Do you forget the USSD code frequently? With Balance Inquiry app, you will not have to worry more about it. Just tap on the icon and your balance will show up. Pretty useful if you are switching the sim card in your device.

IMPORTANT:
Before write a bad review / low rate, send me an email with the name of your carrier and country. Keep in mind the difficulty for supporting all the carriers around the world, so some of them may be missing in the app. I am adding them on user requests via email.

If the USSD code is invalid, please contact me and I will try to help you as soon as possible.
